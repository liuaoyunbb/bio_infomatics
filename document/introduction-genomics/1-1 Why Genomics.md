This lecture is about why we study genomics and what it can teach us. So genomics is the study of the genomes inside of us. Let's talk about human genomics. 
这次讲座是关于我们为什么研究基因组学以及它可以教我们什么。基因组学是对我们内部基因组的研究。让我们来谈谈人类基因组学。

Everybody on the planet has a genome that has governed their development and governs a lot of their biology, and as you can see by looking at any crowd of people, we all look really different. However we've discovered through sequencing in recent years that we're actually 99.9% identical or even more than that. So it's really remarkable how much diversity you can create from a very small number of changes in your genome. But of course, now that we know that we're 99.9% identical, we still want to know, what is it that's driving all these differences? Why is one person tall and another person short? Why does one person live to be 100 an another person lives to be not 100? Why does one person get cancer and another person not? Many of these things we suspect are driven by our genomes, and we want to understand that. 地球上的每个人都有一个基因组，该基因组支配着他们的发育并且只配置许多生物学，正如你可以观察许多人，我们都看起来不一样。但是，近些年通过测序发现，我们实际上有99.9%的一致性，甚至更高。因此，从基因组中很少的变化中可以创造很多多样性，这是非常了不起的。但是，既然我们知道我们有99.9％的一致性，那么我们仍然想知道，是什么促使所有这些差异？
为什么一个人高而另一个人矮？ 为什么一个人能活到100岁，而另一个人活不到100岁？为什么一个人得癌症而另一个人不会得癌症？我们怀疑这些是由我们的基因驱动的，我们希望了解这一点。

So, another thing, one of the most basic things that our genome determines is how our bodies develop. We start off, as you all know, we start off as a single cell which divides into a few apparently identical cells, but that quickly divides into an embryo, and eventually grows into a whole person. And somehow that entire program of development is encoded in our genome, and this is something that we don't yet understand. In addition, the code in our cells determines all the different cell types and for example, it determines how to make a neuron, which is a very complicated cell, obviously a very different kind of cell from say a skin cell, it does very different things. And yet the genome inside of a neuron in your body is identical to the genome inside of any of your skin cells. So we want to understand what's going on in that cell even though it has the same program, the same code, somehow it's executing a different program to make it into a neuron versus a skin cell. 
因此，其中一件最基本的事，基因组决定了我们的身体如何发育。众所周知，我们从一个细胞开始，这个细胞分裂成几个近乎相似的细胞，但很快分裂成一个胚胎，最终长成一个完整的人。而且整个发育程序都以牟宗方式编码在我们的基因组中，这是我们尚未了解的。此外，我们细胞中的代码决定了所有不同的细胞类型，它决定了如何生成神经元，这是一个非常复杂的细胞，显然与皮肤细胞非常不同，它的作用也大不相同。但是体内神经元的基因组和体内皮肤细胞的基因组确是相同的。因此我们想要知道细胞中发生的事情，即使有相同的程序，相同的代码，以某种方式执行了不同的程序，使其变成了神经元和皮肤细胞。
is identical to(与...相同)

Another big area of research in genomics is cancer. So cancer is essentially a genetic disease, we know now. Cancer cells are simply, again, cells in your body that have the same genetic code, the same genome in them, but somehow they've gone haywire, and they've started replicating without control. That's what makes something cancerous. Basically it's cells that are dividing without any check on their division. And, in fact, we define cancers by the type of cell that started the cancer. So there's skin cancer, where a skin cell starts dividing without control. It's also called melanoma. There's lung cancer. There's blood cancers that are called leukemia. These are all defined by the cells that started the cancer out and they all have a common phenotype, that is, they all have a common feature that they're dividing without control. But the consequence of different cancers are very different, and in fact, the mutations in our DNA that cause these cells to become cancerous are also different.
基因组学的另一大研究领域是癌症。因此，我们现在知道，癌症实质上是一种遗传疾病。同样，癌细胞只是体内的细胞，具有相同的遗传密码，相同的基因组，但不知何故，它们已经陷入困境，并且开始不受控制地复制。那就是使某些东西变得癌变的原因。基本上是细胞分裂而无需检查其分裂。而且，实际上，我们通过引发癌症的细胞类型来定义癌症。因此，有皮肤癌，皮肤细胞开始不受控制地分裂。也称为黑色素瘤。有肺癌，有被称为白血病的血液癌症。这些都是由引发癌症的细胞所定义的，并且它们都有共同的表型，也就是说，它们都有共同的特征，即它们不受控制地分裂。但是，不同癌症的后果是非常不同的，事实上，导致这些细胞癌变的DNA突变也不同。

So what do our genes have to do with any of this? So what I'm talking about, I just mentioned the word mutation, a mutation is a change in your genome. And that can happen because your DNA is damaged, it can happen because of an accident in replication. So every time your cells divide, to explain that latter point, every time your cells divide, the entire genome has to be copied. And our cells are really, really good at this, fortunately, otherwise we wouldn't exist. We wouldn't survive for very long, but once in a while, they make an error, probably only one to three errors per cell division. And once in a while, that error causes something bad to happen, and we believe a lot of cancers are caused by these sort of accidental errors. And understanding that is a matter of understanding, well okay, my cell makes an error, what does it mean for a mutation or an error in replication to turn a cell cancerous? What usually we think happens is that that mutation effects a gene which now doesn't function properly and that gene, for example, that might be a gene that controls cell division, and now you've sort of turned off the check on cell division. And now the cell starts replicating without control and you have a cancer. So that's the kind of thing we're looking at when we're using genomics to study cancer.
那么我们的基因与这一切有什么关系呢？所以我所说的，我刚才提到了突变一词，突变是您基因组的变化。这可能是因为您的DNA受损，也可能是由于复制发生意外。因此，每当您的细胞分裂时，为解释后者，每当您的细胞分裂时，就必须复制整个基因组。幸运的是，我们的细胞确实非常擅长于此，否则我们将不复存在。我们无法生存很长时间，但有时会出错，每个细胞分裂可能只有一到三个错误。
有时，该错误会导致某些不良情况的发生，而且我们认为，许多癌症是由此类意外错误引起的。理解就是了解，好吧，我的细胞出错了，对于突变或复制错误来说，使细胞癌变意味着什么？通常我们会想到的是，这种突变会影响一个现在无法正常运行的基因，例如该基因可能是控制细胞分裂的基因，现在您已经关闭了对细胞分裂的检查。现在，细胞开始不受控制地复制，您得了癌症。因此，这就是我们使用基因组学研究癌症时要考虑的事情。

So how does this all work? So this program that I'm talking about that's encoded in our DNA. Well there's something called the central dogma. I didn't make that word up, that phrase was created by Francis Crick and one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA over fifty years ago.
那么，这一切如何运作？ 我正在谈论的这个程序是在我们的DNA中编码的。 这就是所谓的中心法则。 我没有把这个词弄清楚，central dogma是弗朗西斯·克里克（Francis Crick）创造的，他是五十多年前DNA结构的共同发现者之一。
And it's now still used, even though as with many dogma, it's not an absolute dogma. But the central dogma of biology, or molecular biology, says that Information flows in a single direction from your genome, that is your DNA, to RNA, to proteins. And the processes that govern that we give different names. So the copying, when DNA is turned into genes, the first step is you take pieces of it called exons, and you transcribe them, that's the copying process, into RNA, and RNA is essentially an exact copy of the DNA where all the letters are the same with the only difference being the letter t, or thiamine becomes a letter u, which is uracil. But otherwise it's molecularly the same thing. 
现在它仍然被使用，即使与许多法则一样，它也不是绝对的法则。 但是生物学或分子生物学的中心法则表示，信息沿着单一方向从您的基因组（即您的DNA）到RNA，再到蛋白质。 以及支配我们命名的流程。 所以复制，当DNA变成基因时，第一步是将其片段称为外显子(exons)，然后将其转录，即复制过程，复制为RNA，而RNA本质上是DNA的精确副本，其中所有字母 相同，唯一的不同是字母t，硫胺素(thiamine)变成字母u，即尿嘧啶(uracil)。 但除此之外，它在分子上(molecularly)是相同的。

That RNA then has to be turned into a protein. Now, proteins are not comprised of these four letters of nucleic acids. They're comprised of 20 letters that are called the abbreviations for amino acids and proteins are also long molecules, not nearly as long as DNA. A typical protein might be 300 or 400 amino acids long, and the way you get a protein is you take a piece of RNA and you read it three letters at a time, and each triplet encodes an amino acid. And if you think about it for a second there's four possible RNA nucleotides. So there's four to the third, or 64 possible combinations. Each of those 64 triplets each gets translated either into amino acid or not. 
然后该RNA必须转变为蛋白质。 现在，蛋白质不再由这四个核酸(nucleic acids)字母组成。 它们由20个字母组成，被称为氨基酸(amino acids)和蛋白质的缩写，它们也是长分子(molecules)，长度不如DNA。 一个典型的蛋白质可能长300或400个氨基酸，而获得蛋白质的方式是获取一块RNA，一次读取三个字母，每个三联体编码一个氨基酸。 如果想一秒钟，就会发现有四个可能的RNA核苷酸(nucleotides)。 因此，共有四到三种或64种可能的组合。 这64个三胞胎中的每一个都翻译成氨基酸或不翻译成氨基酸。

There's three special ones called stop codons. They indicate the end of a protein. So that's basically how DNA goes and becomes a protein. And the proteins kind of do all the work of your cells. So the proteins in your body are what are actually doing most of the functional work of say, metabolizing things, digesting your food, moving things around in the cells. So that fundamental dogma has been around for many decades now, and it more or less describes how information flows most of the time from your genome to two proteins. However, that's not the whole picture, we now know. So over time, we've learned that information can flow the other way, and as scientists got more familiar with the whole model, they realized that it had to form the other way. 
有三个特殊密码子称为终止密码子。 它们指示蛋白质的末端。 因此，这基本上就是DNA变成蛋白质的方式。 蛋白质可以完成细胞的所有工作。 因此，人体中的蛋白质实际上就是大部分功能性工作，例如，代谢事物，消化食物，在细胞内移动事物。 因此，基本的法则已经存在了数十年，它或多或少地描述了信息在大多数时间是如何从基因组流向两种蛋白质的。 但是，我们现在知道的还不是全部。 因此，随着时间的流逝，我们已经了解到信息可以以另一种方式流动，并且随着科学家对整个模型的更加熟悉，他们意识到信息必须以另一种方式形成。

As I was saying a little earlier in this lecture, there are many different cell types in your body, every cell has the same exact DNA. So if everything just flowed from the DNA to the proteins, it would seem sort of fundamentally impossible for the cells to behave differently, yet we know that neurons don't act like skin cells. So what's going on? So the proteins themselves, some of the proteins that are created by the DNA go back and bind to that DNA stuff and modify it and change the genes that get turned on and off. So proteins can self regulate in this way. And there are other things that can happen with DNA, other modifiers, some are called methylation marks that can change DNA as well. So there are features on the DNA that are affected by the proteins themselves. So this feedback loops in the process in this sort of information flow, and that as a result, information's actually flowing backwards. 
就像我之前说的那样，您体内的细胞类型很多，每个细胞都有相同的确切DNA。 因此，如果一切都从DNA流向蛋白质，从根本上说，细胞的行为不同是不可能的，但我们知道神经元的作用和皮肤细胞的作用是不同的。 发生什么了？ 因此，蛋白质本身，即由DNA产生的某些蛋白质，可以返回并与该DNA物质结合并对其进行修饰，并改变打开和关闭的基因。 因此蛋白质可以通过这种方式自我调节。 DNA还有其他可能发生的事情，其他修饰剂也称为甲基化(methylation)标记，它们也可以改变DNA。 因此，DNA上的某些特征会受到蛋白质本身的影响。 因此，这种反馈会在这种信息流中循环进行，结果实际上是信息向后流动。

So in the genomics field, so how do we make these measurements that I'm talking about? How do we measure if you want to understand cancer, then we have to go and get some cancer cells and figure out what mutations happen in the cells. So how do we do that? Do that with sequencing. So sequencing is sort of at the heart of genomics, and the genomics revolution that we've been in for about the past 20 years, and this really accelerated over the past ten years. And one reason for this acceleration is that genome technology has gotten incredibly fast and efficient. So what you're looking at here are some of the latest sequencing machines. A sequencer today, the highest super sequencer we have today can sequence in a single run of the machine, as many as a trillion nucleotides of DNA. So to give you a sense of what that means, the Human Genome Project was started in 1989 with the goal of sequencing one human genome in 15 years. It beat that goal, we actually published the human genome in 2001, so in just 12 years we finished the project. I was part of that project. And it was a massive effort involving thousands of scientists from around the world. 
因此，在基因组学领域，我们如何进行我正在谈论的这些测量？如果您想了解癌症，我们该如何测量，那么我们必须去获取一些癌细胞，并弄清楚细胞中发生了什么突变。那么我们该怎么做呢？进行测序(sequencing)。因此测序一直是基因组学的核心，也是过去20年来我们一直在进行的基因组学革命，而这在过去十年中确实在加速。加速的原因之一是基因组技术变得异常快速和高效。因此，您在这里看到的是一些最新的测序仪。今天的测序仪，是当今我们拥有的最高的超级测序仪，可以在机器的一次运行中进行测序，多达一万亿个核苷酸。因此，为了让您了解这意味着什么，人类基因组计划始于1989年，目标是在15年内对一个人类基因组进行测序。为了实现这一目标，我们实际上是在2001年发布了人类基因组，因此在短短12年内，我们完成了该项目。我是那个项目的一部分。这是来自世界各地成千上万科学家的巨大努力。

And sequencers were employed at half a dozen huge genome sequencing centers in the US, and large sequencing centers in the UK, in France, in China, all over the world. Today you can get a sequencer in a single lab, one of these machines run by a single investigator, and in just a few days, you can sequence on the order of several hundred human genome equivalents. So now we're in maybe a little more than a dozen years after the completion of the human genome. 12 year project involving thousands of scientists. Now a single scientist in one day can do far more sequencing than that entire consortium did. So that's allowed us to start looking at things like cancer genomics. When the human genome was published in 2001, no one at that time thought it was even remotely feasible to start sequencing the entire genome of a single tumor, and yet today, we have literally tens of thousands of projects going on around the world doing exactly that. So the result of that is that we are generating these enormous, enormous data sets. 
美国有六个超大型基因组测序中心，英国，法国，中国也有大型测序中心。今天，您可以在一个实验室中获得一个测序仪，由一位研究人员在其中一台机器上运行，而在短短几天内，您就可以对数百个人类基因组当量进行测序。所以现在我们距人类基因组完成已经有十几年了。为期12年的项目，涉及数千名科学家。现在，一个科学家一天之内就能完成比整个财团更多的测序工作。因此，这使我们可以开始研究诸如癌症基因组学之类的东西。当人类基因组在2001年发表时，当时没有人认为对单个肿瘤的整个基因组进行测序甚至是遥不可及的，但是今天，我们在世界各地确实有成千上万个正在进行的项目。因此，结果就是我们正在生成这些巨大的数据集。

So sure we can sequence all that data, but what I didn't say was that towards the end of the Human Genome Project, when we were at the point where we were writing the paper, and I was part of one of the teams that was doing that, we had hundreds of scientists frantically trying to analyze all this data from a single genome and figure out what we could say about it in a scientific paper. So today, one investigator, one lab, can generate multiple genomes in a space of a week, but that doesn't mean that in the space of a week, or a few days, you can analyze all that data, not at all. 
因此，我们可以对所有这些数据进行排序，但是我没有说的是，在人类基因组计划即将结束之时，那时我们正在撰写论文，而我是其中一个团队的一员，我们有数百名科学家疯狂地尝试分析单个基因组中的所有数据，并在科学论文中弄清楚我们可以说些什么。 因此，今天，一个研究人员，一个实验室可以在一周的时间内生成多个基因组，但这并不意味着您可以在一周或几天的时间内分析所有数据。

So you need powerful computers running for days or even weeks just to churn through the data and turn it into something that a person can look at. And there's many different questions you can ask about it. One question that I sort of already alluded to is, you can ask well, what are the mutations in this cell versus other cells from the same person? So that's say, a kind of question you could ask. That requires significant amounts of computing to take that bewildering massive data and turn into something comprehensible to a group of scientists who can then analyze it. So another thing that's driven this revolution is not just the efficiency but the cost. So the same that things are gotten faster, and more efficient that way, they've also got much cheaper. So this plot that you're looking at now shows you the rough cost per human genome equivalent going back to around the time the human genome was completed. 
因此，您需要功能强大的计算机，运行数天甚至数周，将其转化为人可看的数据。 您可以提出许多不同的问题。 例如与同一个人的其他细胞相比，细胞突变是什么？ 就是说，您可能会问一个问题。 这就需要大量的计算来处理这些令人费解的海量数据，并转化为一组科学家可以理解的东西，然后再对其进行分析。 因此，推动这场革命的另一件事不仅是效率，还在于成本。 因此，事情变得更快，更高效，它们也变得便宜得多。 因此，您现在正在看的这张图向您显示了每个人类基因组当量的粗略成本，可以追溯到人类基因组完成的时间。

So when the human genome was finished in 2001, the scientific community then proceeded with several other important mammalian genomes that are about the same size, such as the mouse genome, and the cow genome, and these are genomes that, like human, are around two and a half to three billion base pairs long. And those projects cost on the order of $25 or $30 million to sequence. So that cost started to drop, from that point on dropped very rapidly, and then around 2007, there's an introduction of a new technology from a company called Solexa, now called Illumina, that led to even more rapid drops in cost, because the sequencing technology itself changed really dramatically and we'll talk about that a little bit later in this course. But as a result, the sequencing cost today for a human genome is on the order of $1000. So we've gone from $25 to $30 million to $1,000 in the space of about a dozen years. And that opens up a world of experiments that we didn't think were feasible before, not only because of the time involved but also because of the cost. So finally, where is all this data? So there are now trillions of bases of data that have already been generated.
因此，当人类基因组在2001年完成时，科学界便着手研究了其他几个大小大致相同的重要哺乳动物基因组，例如小鼠基因组和牛基因组，这些基因组与人类一样都在周围。两个半到30亿个碱基对。这些项目的成本约为25或3000万美元。因此，成本开始下降，从那时起下降非常快，然后在2007年左右，有一家名为Solexa（现在称为Illumina）的公司引入了一项新技术，导致成本下降得更快，因为测序技术本身发生了巨大的变化，我们将在本课程的后面部分讨论这一点。但是结果，今天人类基因组的测序成本约为1000美元。因此，在大约十二年的时间里，我们已经从25美元增加到3000万美元，再到1000美元。这就打开了一个我们以前认为不可行的实验世界，这不仅是因为所涉及的时间而且还因为成本。那么最后，所有这些数据在哪里？因此，现在已经产生了数万亿的数据基础。

You and I can go and download this data and study it ourselves. Even though this data has been published and deposited in public archives, that doesn't mean that there's nothing more to learn from it. The convention in the field is that once you publish a paper describing some genomic data set, you're required to release it, and generally release it with no restrictions. So there's a terrific set of repositories of all this data. The biggest one is the National Center for Biotechnology Information or NCBI. The raw data is deposited there in something called the Sequence Read Archive or SRA. But many more databases are contained within NCBI that contain, for example, the names and locations of all the genes that are present in all the genomes that we've been sequencing. So this is a great resource for people who want to go and try to make new discoveries, not only about the human genome, but about the many other thousands of species that we're engaged in sequencing.
我们可以去下载这些数据并自行研究。 即使这些数据已经发布并存储在公共档案中，这也不意味着没有其他可学之处。 该领域的惯例是，一旦发布描述某些基因组数据集的论文，就需要发布它，并且通常没有限制地发布它。 因此，所有这些数据都有一组出色的存储库。 最大的是国家生物技术信息中心或NCBI。 原始数据存储在那里，称为“序列读取档案”或SRA。 但是NCBI内包含了更多数据库，例如，这些数据库包含了我们一直在测序的所有基因组中存在的所有基因的名称和位置。 因此，这对于想要去尝试发现新发现的人们来说是一个巨大的资源，不仅涉及人类基因组，而且涉及我们从事测序的其他数千种物种。
