This lecture is about why we study genomics and what it can teach us. So genomics is the study of the genomes inside of us. Let's talk about human genomics. 
这次讲座是关于我们为什么研究基因组学以及它可以教我们什么。基因组学是对我们内部基因组的研究。让我们来谈谈人类基因组学。

Everybody on the planet has a genome that has governed their development and governs a lot of their biology, and as you can see by looking at any crowd of people, we all look really different. However we've discovered through sequencing in recent years that we're actually 99.9% identical or even more than that. So it's really remarkable how much diversity you can create from a very small number of changes in your genome. But of course, now that we know that we're 99.9% identical, we still want to know, what is it that's driving all these differences? Why is one person tall and another person short? Why does one person live to be 100 an another person lives to be not 100? Why does one person get cancer and another person not? Many of these things we suspect are driven by our genomes, and we want to understand that. 地球上的每个人都有一个基因组，该基因组支配着他们的发育并且只配置许多生物学，正如你可以观察许多人，我们都看起来不一样。但是，近些年通过测序发现，我们实际上有99.9%的一致性，甚至更高。因此，从基因组中很少的变化中可以创造很多多样性，这是非常了不起的。但是，既然我们知道我们有99.9％的一致性，那么我们仍然想知道，是什么促使所有这些差异？
为什么一个人高而另一个人矮？ 为什么一个人能活到100岁，而另一个人活不到100岁？为什么一个人得癌症而另一个人不会得癌症？我们怀疑这些是由我们的基因驱动的，我们希望了解这一点。

So, another thing, one of the most basic things that our genome determines is how our bodies develop. We start off, as you all know, we start off as a single cell which divides into a few apparently identical cells, but that quickly divides into an embryo, and eventually grows into a whole person. And somehow that entire program of development is encoded in our genome, and this is something that we don't yet understand. In addition, the code in our cells determines all the different cell types and for example, it determines how to make a neuron, which is a very complicated cell, obviously a very different kind of cell from say a skin cell, it does very different things. And yet the genome inside of a neuron in your body is identical to the genome inside of any of your skin cells. So we want to understand what's going on in that cell even though it has the same program, the same code, somehow it's executing a different program to make it into a neuron versus a skin cell. 
因此，其中一件最基本的事，基因组决定了我们的身体如何发育。众所周知，我们从一个细胞开始，这个细胞分裂成几个近乎相似的细胞，但很快分裂成一个胚胎，最终长成一个完整的人。而且整个发育程序都以牟宗方式编码在我们的基因组中，这是我们尚未了解的。此外，我们细胞中的代码决定了所有不同的细胞类型，它决定了如何生成神经元，这是一个非常复杂的细胞，显然与皮肤细胞非常不同，它的作用也大不相同。但是体内神经元的基因组和体内皮肤细胞的基因组确是相同的。因此我们想要知道细胞中发生的事情，即使有相同的程序，相同的代码，以某种方式执行了不同的程序，使其变成了神经元和皮肤细胞。
is identical to(与...相同)

Another big area of research in genomics is cancer. So cancer is essentially a genetic disease, we know now. Cancer cells are simply, again, cells in your body that have the same genetic code, the same genome in them, but somehow they've gone haywire, and they've started replicating without control. That's what makes something cancerous. Basically it's cells that are dividing without any check on their division. And, in fact, we define cancers by the type of cell that started the cancer. So there's skin cancer, where a skin cell starts dividing without control. It's also called melanoma. There's lung cancer. There's blood cancers that are called leukemia. These are all defined by the cells that started the cancer out and they all have a common phenotype, that is, they all have a common feature that they're dividing without control. But the consequence of different cancers are very different, and in fact, the mutations in our DNA that cause these cells to become cancerous are also different.
基因组学的另一大研究领域是癌症。因此，我们现在知道，癌症实质上是一种遗传疾病。同样，癌细胞只是体内的细胞，具有相同的遗传密码，相同的基因组，但不知何故，它们已经陷入困境，并且开始不受控制地复制。那就是使某些东西变得癌变的原因。基本上是细胞分裂而无需检查其分裂。而且，实际上，我们通过引发癌症的细胞类型来定义癌症。因此，有皮肤癌，皮肤细胞开始不受控制地分裂。也称为黑色素瘤。有肺癌，有被称为白血病的血液癌症。这些都是由引发癌症的细胞所定义的，并且它们都有共同的表型，也就是说，它们都有共同的特征，即它们不受控制地分裂。但是，不同癌症的后果是非常不同的，事实上，导致这些细胞癌变的DNA突变也不同。

So what do our genes have to do with any of this? So what I'm talking about, I just mentioned the word mutation, a mutation is a change in your genome. And that can happen because your DNA is damaged, it can happen because of an accident in replication. So every time your cells divide, to explain that latter point, every time your cells divide, the entire genome has to be copied. And our cells are really, really good at this, fortunately, otherwise we wouldn't exist. We wouldn't survive for very long, but once in a while, they make an error, probably only one to three errors per cell division. And once in a while, that error causes something bad to happen, and we believe a lot of cancers are caused by these sort of accidental errors. And understanding that is a matter of understanding, well okay, my cell makes an error, what does it mean for a mutation or an error in replication to turn a cell cancerous? What usually we think happens is that that mutation effects a gene which now doesn't function properly and that gene, for example, that might be a gene that controls cell division, and now you've sort of turned off the check on cell division. And now the cell starts replicating without control and you have a cancer. So that's the kind of thing we're looking at when we're using genomics to study cancer.
那么我们的基因与这一切有什么关系呢？所以我所说的，我刚才提到了突变一词，突变是您基因组的变化。这可能是因为您的DNA受损，也可能是由于复制发生意外。因此，每当您的细胞分裂时，为解释后者，每当您的细胞分裂时，就必须复制整个基因组。幸运的是，我们的细胞确实非常擅长于此，否则我们将不复存在。我们无法生存很长时间，但有时会出错，每个细胞分裂可能只有一到三个错误。
有时，该错误会导致某些不良情况的发生，而且我们认为，许多癌症是由此类意外错误引起的。理解就是了解，好吧，我的细胞出错了，对于突变或复制错误来说，使细胞癌变意味着什么？通常我们会想到的是，这种突变会影响一个现在无法正常运行的基因，例如该基因可能是控制细胞分裂的基因，现在您已经关闭了对细胞分裂的检查。现在，细胞开始不受控制地复制，您得了癌症。因此，这就是我们使用基因组学研究癌症时要考虑的事情。

So how does this all work? So this program that I'm talking about that's encoded in our DNA. Well there's something called the central dogma. I didn't make that word up, that phrase was created by Francis Crick and one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA over fifty years ago.
那么，这一切如何运作？ 我正在谈论的这个程序是在我们的DNA中编码的。 这就是所谓的中心法则。 我没有把这个词弄清楚，central dogma是弗朗西斯·克里克（Francis Crick）创造的，他是五十多年前DNA结构的共同发现者之一。
And it's now still used, even though as with many dogma, it's not an absolute dogma. But the central dogma of biology, or molecular biology, says that Information flows in a single direction from your genome, that is your DNA, to RNA, to proteins. And the processes that govern that we give different names. So the copying, when DNA is turned into genes, the first step is you take pieces of it called exons, and you transcribe them, that's the copying process, into RNA, and RNA is essentially an exact copy of the DNA where all the letters are the same with the only difference being the letter t, or thiamine becomes a letter u, which is uracil. But otherwise it's molecularly the same thing. 
现在它仍然被使用，即使与许多法则一样，它也不是绝对的法则。 但是生物学或分子生物学的中心法则表示，信息沿着单一方向从您的基因组（即您的DNA）到RNA，再到蛋白质。 以及支配我们命名的流程。 所以复制，当DNA变成基因时，第一步是将其片段称为外显子(exons)，然后将其转录，即复制过程，复制为RNA，而RNA本质上是DNA的精确副本，其中所有字母 相同，唯一的不同是字母t，硫胺素(thiamine)变成字母u，即尿嘧啶(uracil)。 但除此之外，它在分子上(molecularly)是相同的。

That RNA then has to be turned into a protein. Now, proteins are not comprised of these four letters of nucleic acids. They're comprised of 20 letters that are called the abbreviations for amino acids and proteins are also long molecules, not nearly as long as DNA. A typical protein might be 300 or 400 amino acids long, and the way you get a protein is you take a piece of RNA and you read it three letters at a time, and each triplet encodes an amino acid. And if you think about it for a second there's four possible RNA nucleotides. So there's four to the third, or 64 possible combinations. Each of those 64 triplets each gets translated either into amino acid or not. 
然后该RNA必须转变为蛋白质。 现在，蛋白质不再由这四个核酸(nucleic acids)字母组成。 它们由20个字母组成，被称为氨基酸(amino acids)和蛋白质的缩写，它们也是长分子(molecules)，长度不如DNA。 一个典型的蛋白质可能长300或400个氨基酸，而获得蛋白质的方式是获取一块RNA，一次读取三个字母，每个三联体编码一个氨基酸。 如果想一秒钟，就会发现有四个可能的RNA核苷酸(nucleotides)。 因此，共有四到三种或64种可能的组合。 这64个三胞胎中的每一个都翻译成氨基酸或不翻译成氨基酸。
